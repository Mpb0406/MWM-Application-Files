## • Question 2 - What are some ways to improve the security of a Unix/Linux system? Include general security guidelines and any specifics related to web servers and db servers.
Linux is generally pretty secure, however linux servers are susceptible to brute force attacks usually only when the user doesn't take any precaution. Some things you can do to improve security include making sure updates are installed/automatic updates so your server is never vulnerable, use SSH keys rather than standard username/password, use a firewall, create server backups, disabling any open ports.


## • Question 4 - In your view, what are the pros and cons of TDD (test driven development). When do you think TDD makes more/less sense?
Test Driven Development can slow down the development process overall, however it allows you to build in smaller, more meaningful pieces while paying close attention to detail and eliminating possible bugs. It allows you to efficiently evaluate all test-cases for features and prevent any defects that could arise down the line and catch them before a product gets to production. I think testing as much as possible is a good idea, however you do have to consider time/cost. It may not make sense to unit test every single function of an application, especially if it will slow down the process too much.

## • Question 5 - Do you have any favorite coding related quotes or cartoons?
